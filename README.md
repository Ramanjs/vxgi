# interactive-global-illumination
OpenGL engine for rendering scenes with global illumination in real-time using a voxel cone tracer.

TODO:
* Refactor voxelization procedure into a separate class
* Shadow map tight bound using AABB
* Additional Textures
* Specular Cones
* Interactive imgui interface to edit light, material and models
* Take atomic max of a colour for each voxel
* Conservative Rasterization
* Compute two light bounces
* Emissive materials
* Possibly use assimp for a PBR based pipeline
* Sparse voxel octree
